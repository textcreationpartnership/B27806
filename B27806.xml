            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>COmmon Experience tells us that the meanest Plant is influenced from Heaven as well as the greatest Oak or Cedar, tho' not so much, because it doth not take up so much room, nor is so useful in the World.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Christ is given to every Man to Profit withal, by him that distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to every Man severally as he will. We can understand nothing so perfectly as that which we do understand by Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Weight or Measure; and it is for this Cause that God hath been pleased to give us the Knowledge of himself in an Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:39582:4"/> according to the Measure of the Age and Fulness of Christ, as it is Written, and easie to be read, <hi>Prov. 22. 20. Have not I written to thee Threes, or a Trinity in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Knowledge, to make thee know the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Words of Truth:</hi> But all the things of God which are above this are out of our reach, for they are above our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding beyond our Measure, and do exceed our Number, yet they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot contrary to our Reason, or contrary to our Faith, which comes to believe the Incomprehensibleness of God, as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> was led into the Waters of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary by Measure, 'till they came to be a River which no Man could pass over.</p>
            <p>The Measure of Time used in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are <hi>Seven</hi> and <hi>Ten</hi> Years, taken from the beginning of the Old or New Creation, and increased by an Arithmetick or Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Progression of Years which are not to be reduced from a greater to a less Proportion, any more than the Four Months before Harvest can be computed with the Solar Year, in which the Jews did Celebrate but three Festivals.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:39582:4"/>
            <p>Nor doth the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> consist in likeness only between him and Christ, as some Men may think, but in Order of Time, as he was first King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and after that King of Peace.</p>
            <p>Typical Numbers that compute a Day for a Year have equal Warrant with the great Year of Redemption, which is graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Solar Year, which was every Year Celebrated by the Jews, and with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> which is Ten Years for every Day, divided by 5 and 5 Years, Beginning at the Promise, and Ending with the last Day of Redemption, without any Day more or less.</p>
            <p>Such as conclude the three Persons in Holy Trinity are denyed, are mistaken; but in regard some sharp Disputes have arisen in former times, they are here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by the Holy Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of God in Jesus Christ, that was, that is, and that is to come.</p>
            <p>The Mistake of two Years in our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt may prolong the End of the Year of our Redemption from 1690. and half, to 1693. or more.</p>

                  <argument>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis Year of Redemption hath three parts. The first part begins at the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 2078 Year of the World, and ended when <hi>Joseph</hi> was made Ruler in <hi>Egypt</hi> 210 Years after. This 210 Year is called in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>Aleph Dor,</hi> the First Age, and in the Solar Calendar is the three first Weeks of the great Year, which endeth in the Year of the World 2288.</p>
                  <p>The Second part of this great Year is the Ten Years, which began when <hi>Joseph</hi> was made Ruler in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ended when God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was in the 2298 Year of the World, and 220 Year after the Promise, this space of time in the Solar Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar is but one day.</p>
                  <p>The Third Part of this great Year contains the whole time of our Lord's Infancy, while he is put under the Tutors and Governors of this World until the time appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is 70 Jubilees, or 3430 Years, which began at the time when God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and endeth at the measure of the Age and Fulness of Christ as a Perfect Man, which is the end of this World. And this space
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39582:6"/> of time in the Solar Calendar is the 49 Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which are 49 times 70 Years, and end with the last day of the World, which is the 5728 Year of the World, and the 3650 Year after the Promise.

                  <p>BEfore I come to speak of the Measures of the Covenant, and of the Measures of the Age and Fulness of Christ, and the Fulness of the World in him, I thought it necessary to speak first of the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and of the four Symbols of that Covenant, and what they do signifie.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> Ten Years after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which was made in <hi>Ʋr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> in the 70 Year of the Life of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the 2078 Year of the World.</p>
                  <p>The Promise was made by God the Father, but the Covenant was made by God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, even the Holy Trinity of God in Jesus Christ of the one part, and with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> of the other part.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant was a Covenant of Sacrifice for the Death of Christ the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:39582:7"/> and of all the Posterity of the First <hi>Adam</hi> in him, for he Dyed for all because all were dead.</p>
                  <p>The other Covenant is called the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or the Oath of God for the raising up of Christ from the Dead, a New Man, and of a New World in him, who is the beginning of the Creation of God, so that <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all dyed, even so in Christ shall all be made alive</hi> in their proper Time and Order.</p>

                     <p>Of the four Symbols of the Covenant, and what they signifie.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Kingdom Promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon the fourth Generation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Abraham</hi> had no Son when the Covenant was made, therefore the four Symbols did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, the four first Generations according to their Births, and they are called <hi>Aleph Dor,</hi> which is the First Age.</p>
                  <p>These Symbols of the Covenant were Beasts of the Earth and Fowls of Heaven; the Beasts of the Earth are Beasts of Sacrifice, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Jesus Christ coming in the Flesh of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be a Sacrifice for the sins of the World, that Salvation might be of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:39582:7"/>
                  <p>The Fowls of Heaven did represent Jesus Christ risen from the Dead, and all the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual People in the dayes of the Gospel after his Resurrection.</p>
                  <p>The Beasts of Sacrifice were a Calf, and a Goat, and a Ram, which were as well num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered as divided, or cut in twain: But the Fowls were neither numbered nor divided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the fourth Generation, and were included in the third. Our Translation saith they were a Turtle-Dove and a young Pigeon, but they were a Turtle-Dove and an Eagle, as the same Word is translated <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 21. these dead Bodies being made alive, are called the Cherubims, whereof the Eagle is one.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Jesus Christ was made a Priest by Oath of God, according to the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck.</hi>

                  <p>THere is one thing farther to be Opened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come to speak of the Measure of the Covenant, and that will be to shew how Christ was made a Priest by Oath of God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Ten Years after the Promise hath in it the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> which is an equal Division of those Ten Years between <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Flesh, and <hi>Abraham</hi> after the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>During the first of these five Years <hi>Abraham</hi> lived after the Flesh under the government of his Natural Father <hi>Terah,</hi> until <hi>Terah</hi> dyed in <hi>Haran.</hi> The other five Years <hi>Abraham</hi> lived
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39582:8"/> after the Spirit; for when his Father <hi>Terah</hi> was dead, he was under the Conduct of the Father of his Spirit, who led him into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and at the end of the second five Years gave him Possession of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promise, and he was blessed of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> the King of Righteousness, who was afterwards King of <hi>Salem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Order was our Lord made a Priest by Oath: The Oath of God is the 7 of God, for <hi>Shebang</hi> signifies Seven as well as to Swear an Oath. As there are two Fives in the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> so are there two Sevens in the Oath of God, for every Oath consists of two Parts, a Blessing and a Curse; the Curse is our own by Nature, and is upon all the Posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> but the Blessing cometh from God only, and that of his Free Grace.</p>
                  <p>Jesus Christ was made a Curse for us after this Order, that we might receive the Blessing in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As <hi>Abraham</hi> abode five Years under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Natural Father, until he dyed in <hi>Haran:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So did our Lord abide 7 times five, even 35 Years, under the Tutors and Governours of the World, which were the Natural Fathers of Christ, the <hi>Jews,</hi> until they Crucified him, and he dyed under the Curse due to our Sins at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> as <hi>Terah</hi> dyed under the first Covenant at <hi>Haran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:39582:9"/>2. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was set free from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Natural Father when he was dead:</p>
                  <p>So was Christ and his Church set free from the Dominion of the Law, of Sin and Death, which was their first Husband or Ruler, that they might be Married to another Husband that dyed for them, and rose again, to Marry them to himself.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was raised up by his Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father after <hi>Terah</hi> was dead, to enter into the Land of Promise, where he was blessed of <hi>Melchisedeck:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So our Lord after he was risen from the Dead received the Promise of the Father, which was the Holy Spirit of Promise shed forth upon his Body the Church at <hi>Pentecost;</hi> but the Harvest of it is reserved for the great <hi>Pentecost</hi> now at hand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As <hi>Abraham</hi> at the end of the second five Years slaughtered the Kings in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So our Lord Jesus at the end of 7 times 5, which was 35 Years from his Resurrection, did slaughter his Enemies, the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Titus Vespasian,</hi> who laid Waste their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Worship and Government, as it appears at this day.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Measures of the Symbols of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did fore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Times in which <hi>Joseph</hi> the fourth Generation should be Ruler in <hi>Egypt 210</hi> Year after the Promise.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Cutting of the Calf in twain Cut off Life from Death, made two Covenants of one. The first Covenant was Death, the other is the New Covenant of Life and Peace in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
                  <p>These two Covenants of Life and Death were equally divided to us in Christ in the four first Generations before they were born, and before the World began, which was when God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as hereafter will be made more plainly to appear.</p>
                  <p>The Number of each Symbol sheweth the time when each of the said Generations should be produced, and the time when <hi>Joseph</hi> should be made Ruler in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the said fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed times were thus limited.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Abraham</hi> Cuts the Calf in twain.</p>
                  <p>This Calf was three Years old, and when it was divided according to the Order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedeck,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:39582:10"/> it was 3 times 5 Natural, and 3 times 5 Years Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>And it came to pass, that at the end of 3 times 5, which is 15 Years next after the Promise, <hi>Abraham</hi> takes <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, or first Covenant, by whom he had his Natural Son <hi>Ishmael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it came to pass also, that 15 Years after <hi>Abraham</hi> had taken <hi>Agar, Isaac</hi> the Son of the Free-woman was born according to Promise.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> Cuts the Goat in twain.</p>
                  <p>This Goat was but 3 Years old, but being add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Calf of 3 Years old it is become 6, and by being Cut in twain it is doubled, that is to say it is 6 and 6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> multiplies the first 6 by the first 5 Years of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> and it becomes 30 for the first Covenant or Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p>And he multiplies the second 6 by the second five Years of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> and it makes 30 more under the New Covenant of Promise.</p>
                  <p>And it came to pass after <hi>Isaac</hi> had waited 60 Years; that is to say 30 Years under the first Testament, and 30 Years more under the New Covenant, which is 60 Years; at the end of the said 60 years <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are born.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:39582:10"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Abraham</hi> Cuts the Ram in twain.</p>
                  <p>This Ram is but 3 years old, but because it is the double of the last, and contains the Third and Fourth Generations, it is called the <hi>Ram of Fulness.</hi> Therefore it must be fourfold double, that is to say 30, 60, 120, which 120 is four times 30, and it is the double of 60, making 12 times Ten, according to the Number of the 12 Tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Jacob</hi> waited 12 times the first five Years of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> under the First Covenant, and 12 times the second 5 years of <hi>Melchisedeck</hi> under the New Covenant, before <hi>Joseph</hi> was made Ruler in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it came to pass, that when <hi>Jacob</hi> was 12 times Ten, that is 120 Years old, his Son <hi>Joseph</hi> being the fourth Generation next after the Promise, was made Ruler in <hi>Egypt</hi> according to the Promise.</p>
                  <p>It is to be Noted that the Ram of Fulness is called so in the Hebrew, but in our Bibles it is called the Ram of Consecration.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That as the Measures of the four Symbols of the Covenant in the last Chapter are four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold double in their Faith and Patience; that is to say, they waited 30, 60, 120 Years, even 3 times Ten, 6 times Ten, and 12 times Ten, which is 210 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Promise, until <hi>Joseph</hi> was made Ruler in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                     <p>Even so from the time that God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> unto <hi>Joseph,</hi> those four Symbols are made alive, and are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cherubims, having their Generation also fourfold double from that Pattern or Fore-appointment of the Covenant, that is to say they are 12 times 70, twenty four times 70, and 48 times 70, which is 3360 Years, unto which if you add the 70 Year of Christ, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, that rideth between the Cherubims, leading <hi>Joseph</hi> like a Flock, it doth compleat the times of this World, from God's going down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to the end of the World, as by the Solar Calendar, and by the 70 Weeks of <hi>Daniel</hi> will most plainly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably appear.</p>

                  <p>THe four Conjugations of the Symbols of the Covenant, were four dead Bodies slain by the smoaking Furnace of the Law in all the four quarters of the World, but they are made alive by the Lamp or Light of the Gospel, shining in their Hearts, so that <hi>as in</hi> Adam <hi>all Men dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even so in Christ shall all be made alive</hi> in their proper time.</p>
                  <p>Three of these Conjugations of dead Bodies were Earth, but the fourth were Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Even so three of the first Cherubims are Beasts of the Earth, and the fourth a flying Eagle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joseph</hi> the fourth Generation was advanced in <hi>Egypt</hi> at the end of 210 years next after the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>Joseph</hi> was not Shepherd of <hi>Israel</hi> until <hi>Israel</hi> went down thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that was Ten years after.</p>
                  <p>The Cherubims had each of them four Faces, that is, they had each of them four times the 210 years of the four first Generations, which is 840 years to each Cherubim, from the time that God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Joseph,</hi> leading <hi>Joseph</hi> like a Flock.</p>
                  <p>The second Cherubin had its four Faces, which was 840 years more, making 24 times 70, which is 1680 years from the time of God's going down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> unto the Birth of Christ, at the fulness of the appointed time.</p>
                  <p>The other two Cherubins are Fowls of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and are the Turtle-Dove and the Eagle, which are neither numbred nor divided, for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39582:12"/> they are the Cherubins of the Resurrection, and do contain 24 times 70, which is 1680 years more from the 70 years of Christ unto the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>Between these four Cherubins the God and Shepherd of <hi>Israel</hi> dwelleth, leading <hi>Joseph</hi> like a Flock, until before <hi>Ephraim, Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi> he stir up his strength and come and save us.</p>

                        <hi>That the four first Generations are an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory of Jesus Christ under the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, as he was after the Flesh, and as he was after the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>AN Allegory is when one thing is spoken and something else is thereby intended to be understood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac; Ishmael</hi> was his First-born, the Son of <hi>Agar</hi> the Bond-woman, he was born after the Flesh; but <hi>Isaac</hi> was his younger Son, born of <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-woman according to Promise.</p>
                  <p>These things were literally true, but as they were an Allegory, <hi>Ishmael</hi> the Son of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman represents Jesus Christ born after the Flesh, the Natural Son and Heir of <hi>Abraham,</hi> born under the Law: But <hi>Isaac</hi> the Son of the Free-woman, born by Promise, represents Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ raised from the dead, according to the New Covenant, the Son and Heir of God, who sets him King upon his Holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free Church casts out the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39582:13"/> Bond-woman and her Son, that they may have no Inheritance with the Son of the Free-woman, for Justification by the Works of the Law, and Justification by Free-Grace may not stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Isaac</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. Esau</hi> was the first born, whose Name doth signifie <hi>the Worker,</hi> a Man of Works. <hi>Jacob</hi> was the younger Son, he was a Perfect Man, dwelling in Tabernacles, for his Tabernacle was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Esau</hi> was a Type of Christ after the Flesh, who fulfilled the Covenant of Works, but <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> is called a Perfect Man.</p>
                  <p>Before <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were born, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had done either Good or Evil, that the Purpose of God concerning Election of Men in Christ by a New Covenant of Grace and not of Works might stand; it was said to <hi>Rebeckah, The elder shall serve the younger, for</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, but I have hated</hi> Esau.</p>
                  <p>We are Chosen in Christ 1890 years before Christ came in the Flesh, according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> 200 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began, or the Foundations thereof were laid; for the Foundations of the World were laid according to the Number of the Sons of <hi>Israel,</hi> whose 12 Sons were not become 70 until God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then they became like the 12 Fountains of <hi>Jacob</hi> and 70 Palm-trees.</p>
                  <p>Even so our Lord, as he was born after the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39582:13"/> Flesh, fulfilled the Righteousness of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which was the first Testament under which he was rejected, when he was made sin for us, for then this Holy <hi>Nazarite</hi> lost those days. and was Baptized from the deadness and unprositableness of those Works of the Law, that he might fulfill all Righteousness, and be justified by the Free Grace of God only, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the New Covenant of Promise.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ruben</hi> was the first-born of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the Birth-right and Blessing was given to <hi>Joseph,</hi> to fall upon the Head of this Shepherd at the utmost bounds of the Hills or Kingdoms of this World, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Prophecy did foretell, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 26.</p>

                  <p>This first Age was Ordained in <hi>Joseph</hi> for a Witness of the time, when the First-born shall be Disinherited, as <hi>Ruben</hi> was, and <hi>Joseph</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased from Prison to Rule the House of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> Psal. 81.</p>

                  <p>Now the third Evidence and Proof that God determined and fore-appointed the times of the World, and the Bounds of the Habitations of all Nations of Men that dwell upon the Face of all the Earth, not to exceed 3650 years from the time of the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> are the Measures of the 70 Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which are 70 Jubilees or 49 Weeks of 70 years to the Week, as they are placed in the Solar Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, for there is not one day more or less from the time of God's going down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to the utmost end or Expiration of the Solar Calendar and of this World, for this is the whole space of Time appointed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which the Heir being a Child, differs nothing from a Servant, tho' he be Lord of all, but is under the Tutors and Governors of this World, until he come to be a Perfect Man at the Measure of the Age and Fulness of Christ.</p>

                  <p>THe Revelation which God makes to us of himself, is not in any one Person, but in an Holy Trinity of God in Jesus Christ; nor is it made known in the Holy Scriptures to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what God is in himself, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what he was, what he is, and what he will be to every one of us in Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>For as he is in himself he is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible of us, he is above our Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and above our Understanding, one whom no Man ever yet saw or can see.</p>

                  <p>Our Translation calls this Witness a Record, but a Record is generally taken for a Writing or a dead Letter, but a Witness is a living Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and so is this Witness living and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerful in us.

                  <p>The Blood of Christ is the first Witness, tho' it be last Named: This Witness was given when the Paschal Lamb was slain in <hi>Egypt</hi> at the Redemption of <hi>Israel,</hi> and this was the daily Witness in the daily Sacrifice, until our Lord dyed for our sins 1505 years after causing that Sacrifice and Oblation to cease.</p>
                  <p>The second Witness upon Earth is Water, the Water of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, which beareth Witness, that it is God in Christ Jesus that Washeth and Cleanseth his Church with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and with the Word, which is the Spirit of

                  <p>The third Witness on Earth is the Witness of the Holy Spirit, that is promised to be poured forth upon all Flesh: <hi>I indeed,</hi> saith <hi>John</hi> Baptist, <hi>Baptize you with Water unto Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose Shoes I am not worthy,</hi> or suited, <hi>to bear, he shall Baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with Fire, whose Fan is in his Hand, he shall throughly purge his floor, and gather the Wheat into his Garner, but will burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire.</hi>

                  <p>IT is Written, <hi>To us a Child is born, to us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his shoulders.</hi> These Words do shew us the Holy Trinity of God in Jusus Christ. <hi>First,</hi> As he is the Son of God by Nature. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As he is the Son of God by Grace. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As he is the King of Glory and Peace.</p>
                  <p>To be a Son by Nature, is to be a Son by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Generation; and so our Lord was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son of God, as the word <hi>Jeled</hi> signifies, only a Natural Generation; there was no other Male that quickned the Female Seed of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Virgin, Mother of our Lord, but the Word of God, and so that Holy Thing born of her was called <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be born by Grace, is the Son that is given to us, when there was nothing of Nature to assist, nothing of Blood, nor of the Will of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Such was the Resurrection of the Son of God, when he was regenerated from the dead, where he lay buryed under the Uncircumcision

                  <p>THis Revelation was made to <hi>Moses</hi> at the Bush, when God said, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> at which <hi>Moses</hi> hid his Face, and was afraid

                  </p>
                  <p>First, He is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is to say, he is God the Father who offered <hi>Isaac</hi> his only begotten Son, in whom all his <hi>seed were called.</hi> Heb. 11. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He is the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> that is, he is the Son of God raised from the dead, from whence <hi>Abraham</hi> received his Son <hi>Isaac in a figure,</hi> Heb. 11. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that is, he is the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> even the Holy Spirit, and King of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is King of the World.</p>
                  <p>This blessed Union of Heaven and Earth, makes our Earth or Humane Nature to be <hi>Adama Kodesh,</hi> holy Ground, and here <hi>Moses</hi>'s Shooes, the Humane Governments of the World, must be drawn or plucked off.</p>

                  <p>THE Holy Trinity is not limited to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in so small a Circle of time, for they were all dead in less than 240 years after the Promise.</p>

                     <p>That the Holy Trinity is revealed by three Homers of Bread.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere were three Homers of Bread from Heaven. The first was the Homer of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> in the Wiiderness. The second was the Homer of the <hi>First-fruits.</hi> The third was the Homer of <hi>Mannah</hi> which was laid up for <hi>their Generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These three Homers were gathered not <hi>at a certain rate</hi> every day, as our <hi>English</hi> Bibles have trarslated it in the Line, but as they have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter transl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Homer of <hi>Mannah</hi> in the Wilderness, which the Fathers did eat of and are dead, was the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>Moses</hi> did not give them the true Bread from Heaven, for it was not the Bread of Life.</p>
                  <p>The second Homer was the living Bread, the Bread of Life, which <hi>came down from Heaven,</hi> the Bread of the First-fruits,<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 33.</note> that Bread which gave Life to the World in Christ, when God raised him from the dead upon the day of First-fruits; and this is of the Free Grace of God, that gave

                  <p>The third Homer is the third Manifestation of God in Christ, which is the Homer of the hidden Mannah laid up in the Ark, which is Christ, untill the day when the Son of Man shall be revealed.

                  <p>As the First-fruits of the Spirit at Pentecost was a Pledge or Earnest that there shall be an Harvest at the end of the appointed Weeks: So the Homer of the First-fruits of the Spirit doth give an Assurance of the greatness of the Harvest from the hidden Mannah, when God shall pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh, and the Gates of Righteousness shall be opened up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the last and great day of the Feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles which is the 8<seg rend="sup">th</seg> day, on which Jesus stands a while and crieth, That if any man thirst, he may come to him and drink: This he spake of the Waters of the Spirit, which they that believe in him shall then receive in all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>

                     <p>That the Holy Trintty was revealed by these three, the Altar, the Sanctuary, and the Holy of Holyest.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Holy of Holyest is the third Heaven into which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up when he heard words unspeakable: Our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles say, they were <hi>not lawfull for a man to utter;</hi> but the Original Phrase doth not imply or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any unlawfulness, but a Non-existence of them to be uttered; that is to say, there was not in his time any footing for them, because they did not relate to the former part of the Tabernacle, which represented Jesus Christ af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flesh, who was made a Sacrifice for our sins; there stood the Brazen Altar, whereon the Priests did daily administer according to the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                  <p>Nor did these <hi>unspeakable</hi> belong to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Tabernacle, called the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> which did represent Christ risen from the dead, to be the Light and the Life of the World; and therefore here was the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Shew-bread and the Candle-stick which was all of Gold, this is Christ in his Church in the dayes of the New Testament, for they were compleat in him who is their Head.</p>

                  <p>But these unspeakable words did relate to the third part of the Tabernacle, which is the Holy of Holiest, representing the Holy Spirit of Truth, which is the Sanctifier of all them that shall be sanctified, not with the outward Holiness which was under the Law in a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sanctuary, nor with the Holiness which is begun under the Gospel, but with the Truth of Holiness.</p>
                  <p>Here was the Ark of the Covenant not then opened, the Pot of Mannah, which was then hidden, and the Rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> not then bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and therefore the Apostle saith, he could not speak those unspeakable words <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>That the Holy Trinity is revealed by three Prophets.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Revelation of God in Christ Jesus, is not made by one Prophet, but by three, at three several Sabbaths or appointed times in the great year of our Redemption, each of them having the word of the day in its day. So that all these three Prophets may prophesie in course, and one of them, which is<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 27.</note> the last, must Interpret, and when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39582:26"/> any thing is revealed to another that sitteth by, the first must hold his peace, for he is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seded; and thus the <hi>Righteousness of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from Faith to Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophets that make this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<note place="margin">Num. 11. 25.</note> are three, <hi>Moses, Eldad</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad. Moses</hi> and his 70 prophesied the Law, while the Spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> rested upon them, and afterward they ceased. These were under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the first Covenant which God made with <hi>Israel,</hi> when he brought them up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Covenant had the Righteousness or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Works, and a worldly Sanctuary, or an external Holiness, which was but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Truth of Holiness.</p>
                  <p>There are two others that prophesied in the Camp, the Name of the one was <hi>Eldad,</hi> and the Name of the Second <hi>Medad;</hi> these remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prophesied in the Scriptures, that is, the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and went not into the Tabernacle, but they prophesied in the Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eldad</hi> is the second Prophet, whose Name sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>Beloved of God.</hi> This is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> after he rose up out of the Waters of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, he sent forth his Seventy before him, two and two into every City and Place where he himself would come.</p>
                  <p>He prophesied in the Scriptures, beginning at <hi>Moses,</hi> and he expounded to his Disciples the things concerning himself.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:39582:26"/>
                  <p>All this was done under the New Covenant or Gospel, which begun at <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, and had the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Medad</hi> is the third Prophet, his Name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>the meafured.</hi> Our Bibles say <hi>the Name of the one was Eldad, and the Name of the other Medad,</hi> but in the Original it is thus, <hi>The Name of the one was Eldad, and the Name of the Second Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have but One Lord Jesus, but he hath two Names, the one is <hi>Grace;</hi> the other is <hi>Truth,</hi> as it is written, <hi>The Law was given by Moses, but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mercy and Truth</hi> was the Name often given to God in Christ under the Old Testament, and when God proclaimed his Name before <hi>Moses,</hi> it was, <hi>Abundant in Goodness and Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two Names of <hi>Mercy and Truth</hi> meet in Christ, when the Holy Spirit of Truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and in, and by, and through Christ, they shall then meet together upon Men, as it is written, <hi>Mercy and Truth</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a great Grace and Favour of God, to warm our Hearts with a sense of his Love in the dayes of the Gospel, which is the Day of Grace, but we have our Coolings and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloudings.

                     <p>That the Holy Trinity shall be one Lord, and his Name One.</p>

                  <p>THe Name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> was not intended to be for ever, but for the World, and so the word <hi>Gnolam</hi> doth import and signifie.</p>
                  <p>When our Lord came into the World, and had all the Power in Heaven and Earth given to him, he Commanded his Disciples to <hi>Teach all Nations, Baptizing them into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and He told them that He was with them <hi>to the end of this World.</hi>

                  <p>God appeared to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> as God Almighty, but by his Name <hi>Jehova</hi> he was not known, 'till the Redemption from <hi>Egypt:</hi> Nor will God be known to us by the Name of the God of Truth until he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all his Promises in Truth: And then when the Work of our Redemption is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, God will be known by a New Name, and will be called the <hi>God of Truth.</hi>

                  <p>The third is Regal, that is, the Subjection of the Female World called <hi>Gnolmah</hi> unto her Male which is called <hi>Gnolam.</hi>

                  <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to hold fast the Ordinances or Traditions which were by him delivered, reciteth these three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That God is the Head of Christ.</p>

                  <p>The Woman is the weaker Vessel, therefore she is put under the Conduct of the Man and his Government.</p>
                  <p>The Man of himself is Naked and Female, but his Femality is United and put under the Conduct and Government of the Male, which is the Prince as well Natural as Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>The Femality of the Prince is United and put in Subjection to the Conduct and Government of God, who is the supream Head and Lord of all, as it is written, <hi>The Lord is his Male or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer.</hi>

                     <p>Of the three Sabbaths or Feasts in which the Holy Trinity of God doth appear.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are three Sabbaths, or Feasts of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> two of which are Sabbaths of the seventh day, the former of them being Sabbath of the seventh day from the Old Creation its beginning. The other is the Sabbath of the seventh day from the beginning of the New Creation, which was the Day of Resurrection of our Lord Jesus from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Both these Sabbaths are Commanded to be kept Holy by the Moral Law in these words, <hi>Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctifie it, the Sabbath of two sevens is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is also written in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that <hi>three times in the Year shall all thy Males appear before the Lord; in the Feast of Ʋnlevened Bread, in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Feast of Unlevened Bread was the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the seventh Day. The Feast of Weeks hath the Sabbath of the first Day; and the Feast of Tabernacles hath the Sabbath of the eighth Day, every one of these Sabbaths hath the word of the Day in its Day.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:39582:30"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Sabbath of the seventh day hath the Word of the Law to shew us our sin, and the Judgment of Death due unto every Sinner, as it was Executed upon Christ, who was put to Death on the Day of the Passover, and lay in Grave on the Sabbath of the seventh day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Sabbath of the first day, this hath the Word or Promise of the Gospel, to shew us our Reconciliation and Atonement by and in the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, who dyed for our Sins, and was raised up again for our Justification, according to the Promise and Oath of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Sabbath of the <hi>8th.</hi> day, hath the Word or Promise of Judgment, and the appointed time in which it shall be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>English</hi> Bibles miss the meaning of the Original, for it is not a certain Rate every day, but it is the Word or Promise of the Day in its Day. <hi>First,</hi> For Sabbaths. <hi>Secondly,</hi> For <hi>Chodeshim</hi> (not New Moons, but) New Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, for that was the antecedent word. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> For <hi>Magnedol,</hi> the Appointed Time, for so is that Word well Translated in our Bibles, <hi>Habac. 2. 2. Psal</hi> 102. 14.</p>
                  <p>Now the Sabbaths were the Sabbaths of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, and the Renovation or Change of them was from the seventh to the first day of the Week in the Feast of Weeks. And the appointed time was the <hi>8th.</hi> day of the Feast of Tabernacles, as the following Words will convince and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39582:31"/> you herein, <hi>viz. Three times in the Year, in the Feast of Ʋnleavened Bread, in the Feast of Weeks, and in the Feast of Tabernacles.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>GOD gave his Sabbath for a Sign between him and his People. The Sabbath of the seventh day was a Sign of our Uncleanness, every Leper was excluded the Camp seven days. Every Man Child is Polluted and Unclean se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days. The Altar was Unclean and Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed seven; the Priests were Unclean seven days; and our Lord Jesus lay buried under the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and Uncleanness of our Flesh upon the Sabbath of the seventh day.</p>
                  <p>The Sabbath of the first day is a Sign, that God is the Lord that sanctifieth us upon this first day of the Week, which is also called the <hi>8th.</hi> day from the beginning; upon this day the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Man-Child doth receive Circumcision as the Seal of the Righteousness of Faith; upon this day every Leper is Cleansed, the Altar and the Priests are sanctified, and on this day our Lord was Circumcised by the Hands of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciser, and upon this day he was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised

                     <p>The Divine Institution of these three Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths or Feasts.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Sabbath of the Passover was Instituted in <hi>Egypt</hi> at the time of <hi>Israel</hi>'s Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at that full Moon which was next after the Vernal Equinox.</p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>14th.</hi> day of this Moon the Paschal Lamb was slain, and all the First-born in <hi>Egypt</hi> dyed. Upon the <hi>15th.</hi> day of this Month <hi>Nisan</hi> was the Sabbath of the Passover, and it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, upon which all <hi>Israel</hi> went out from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Commanded them to keep this Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed that for many Years the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Passover did not fall out to be the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, but upon some other day of the Week, for the Feasts of the <hi>Jews</hi> were moveable, and might fall out near a Month sooner or later in the Year, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Course of the Moon and the time
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39582:32"/> of its Moon conjunction with the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless it pleased the Holy Spirit of Prophecy to signifie before hand from <hi>Egypt,</hi> that our Lord Jesus the true Paschal Lamb should be slain upon the <hi>6th.</hi> day of the Week, and lay in Grave upon the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, which was 1505 years after: And it came to pass accordingly, for the Sabbath of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over did fall out to be upon the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, when our Lord lay in Grave; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jews</hi> called that Sabbath a <hi>Great Day,</hi> because two Sabbaths fell in one day: Our Bibles call it an <hi>High Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon the <hi>14th.</hi> of this Month the Passover was slain as is aforesaid. Upon the <hi>15th.</hi> day was the Sabbath of the Passover, and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row being the first Day of the Week was the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>Nisan,</hi> which was the day of First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits, and the Day of the Resurrection of our Lord; and this Day of First-fruits was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the first Day of the Week, but it was the first Day of the 49 Dayes, which are called the Appointed Weeks of the Harvest; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the first Day of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 49 times 35 of Christ risen from the Dead, which end in Pentecost, which is the <hi>8th.</hi> day, the end of the Harvest of this World.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>MEssiah</hi> is an Hebrew Word as <hi>Christ</hi> is a Greek, but they are both of one and the same signification, which is of a thing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered or Anointed with Oyl.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> You have <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Stone Anointed with Oyl, when he poured Oyl upon its Head, and called it then <hi>Bethel,</hi> the House of God, which before was called <hi>Luz,</hi> an Apostate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> You have the Oyl of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> called the Anoynting Oyl, wherewith <hi>Moses</hi> anoynted the Tabernacle and all its Vessels, to make them holy. <hi>Moses</hi> also anoynted the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Burnt-Offerings, and all its Vessels, whereby it became an Holy Altar. He anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, to make them Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But all this was done for a Witness or Testimony to the things that were to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after, concerning Christ, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> wrote under these Shadows.</p>
                  <p>It may therefore plainly appear, that <hi>Messiah</hi> is some visible Person or Thing that is not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but must be made holy by the Anointing for the Stone of <hi>Jacob</hi> was called <hi>Luz,</hi> an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>state,</hi> before it was anointed, but when it wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:39582:33"/> anointed, it was afterward called <hi>Bethel,</hi> the <hi>House of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It may appear also, that no visible thing or Portion that is to be anointed, neither doth nor can anoint it self, but must be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by some other that hath Power or Holiness to make Holy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Any visible thing or Person thus anointed, is called <hi>the Messiah,</hi> or <hi>the Christ,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> was called, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. Thus the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is anointed by the Divine, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> Stone is called <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the <hi>Stone of Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Our Lord was made Sin for us, as he was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Stone; though in him there was no Sin, yet he bore our Sins, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under the Uncircumcision and Uncleanness of our Flesh. And therefore he was anointed when he arose up from his Burial under the Waters of Baptism.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Hypostatical Ʋnion of God and Man in Christ.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE word <hi>Hypostasis</hi> is but four times used in the Holy Scripture: 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 2. Heb.</hi> 3. 19. in both which places it is translated <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,</hi> and in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1. it is translated <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> but in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. it is translated <hi>Person.</hi> But the word <hi>Hypostasis</hi> doth most properly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Subsidence</hi> or <hi>Settlement</hi> of any liquid thing in the bottom or lowest part, such is the Subsidence of Heaven upon the Horizon of Earth in any Countrey; for the Earth is the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis of Heaven, and the Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Heaven and Earth is an hypostatical Union and Communion. Such is the hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union and Communion of God and Man in Christ, as it is well expressed in the Hebrew Tongue, <hi>Anoki Tirgalti to Ephraim, I went on foot for Ephraim.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hos. 11. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>God was found in fashion as a Man, so that though his Throne be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Isa. 66. 1.</note> yet the Humane Nature of Christ and his Church is Earth, for that is the place where his feet do stand. The Earth is called Gods <hi>Footstool,</hi> and the Ark also, which was a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:39582:34"/> Type of the Humane Nature, in whom God dwells, is also called his <hi>Footstool, Psal,</hi> 99. 1.</p>
                  <p>So that if the Translators had rendred that place, the <hi>character</hi> or <hi>expression of his subsidence</hi> or <hi>subsistence,</hi> it might probably have been as well if not better understood.</p>
                  <p>Jesus Christ is not altogether God, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Man, but he is both God and Man, or God manifest in the Flesh, as the Heavens are made manifest over the Earth, and the Earth is comprehended of the Heaven: So is the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature comprehended of the Divine. And as Heaven and Earth make but one World, so God and Man make but one Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Nature is far above the Humane, as the Heavens are far above the Earth, and the Heavens cannot be measured or known but by the Measures we take of them upon the Earth; even so we cannot know God but by the Measures we take of him in Christ, and we can go no further than when we are come to the Measure of the Age and Fulness of Christ, and to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth and length, the depth and heighth, and to know that Love of Christ which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Knowledge, when we are filled with all the fulness of God in him.</p>
                  <p>The Earth cannot comprehend Heaven, no more can the Humane Nature comprehend the Divine, yet all the Fulness that Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of, dwells in Christ bodily.</p>
                  <p>The Humane Nature is influenced and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:39582:34"/> by the Divine, without which it could do nothing, but as the Earth at so great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is influenced and governed by the Light and Heat of the Sun: So is the Humane Nature influenced and governed by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and as the Rain comes down<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 8.</note> and the Snow from Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns<note place="margin">Isa. 10. 17. 2 Sam. 23. 6.</note> not thither, but waters the Earth, and makes it bring forth Herbs meet for the use of them of whom it is dressed, <hi>receiveth blessing from God; but that which bringeth forth briers and thorns is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Premises it may be observed, That all the Impotence, weakness and infirmity which Christ adscribeth to himself, was in his Humane Nature only, which was crucified through weakness.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all the Honour, Salvation, Glory, Power and Praise is to be given to God only in Jesus Christ, as it is written: <hi>And I John saw these things, and heard them, and when I had heard and seen, I fell down at the feet of him that shewed me these things,</hi> the feet of the Angel; <hi>and he said, See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy Brethren the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of them that keep the sayings of this Book, worship God.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Christ was made a Mediator by Oath.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT was God in Christ that <hi>Mediatored</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> himself by Oath in the Death and Resurrection of Christ, for those are the two <hi>immutable things,</hi> or <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> as the word signifies, wherein it was <hi>impossible for God to lye;</hi> because the Death and Resurrection of Christ were Deeds already done, and could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called or undone, as some men will recall their word and break their Oath.</p>
                  <p>It is from the Impossibility of this Changing that the Heirs of Promise have strong Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and do fly, as our Lord did, unto the Hope that is set before them in Christ.</p>
                  <p>But our Translation doth not make use of the meaning and true intent<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 17.</note> of the Greek word in that place; for they translated it, he <hi>confirmed it by an Oath,</hi> and in the Margin <hi>he interposed by an Oath;</hi> but it ought to have been translated, he <hi>mediatored</hi> or <hi>divided himself in the middle by an Oath;</hi> for God was in Christ that dyed, and therefore his Blood is called <hi>the Blood of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God was also in Christ that was raised from the dead, so that the same God that was God
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:39582:35"/> the Father, who gave his Son to dye, is now the Son of God, for he is Mediator of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p>It was Gods work to give his Son to death, and it was Gods grace to revive his work in the midst of these 70 years, as it was in the midst of these 49 times 70, which is 3430; and so in wrath he remembred Mercy, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 2. The middle of these 70 years was the middle of 3430 years.</p>

                     <p>That Jesus Christ is Mediator of God and Man.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>OUR Bibles have not that place well transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither in the <hi>English,</hi> nor in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. for they read it, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi> But it ought to have been thus translated from the Original, <hi>There is one God and one Mediator of God and of Man;</hi> and it is another thing to be a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and Men:</hi> For to be a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of God and Man,</hi> is to be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> but to be a <hi>Mediatour between God and Man,</hi> doth not describe one of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity with God, and of the same Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39582:36"/> with Men, as our Lord was; but doth rather suppose him to be a third Person, that interposeth himself between God and Man to make Peace. But this is a fundamental Error, that makes void the Free Grace of God; for it separates between the Grace of God and Man, it separates between God and Christ, and between Christ and Men, as if Christ were not of the same Communion with them both. This destroyeth Faith in the Atonement, which is made and perfected by the Death and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ, and leaves the Soul in continual fears, doubts and bondage. But if we hold fast our Faith, by which we are united unto Christ, we can never perish; for if we believe that we are one with him in his Death, so are we in his Resurrection; and because he liveth, we shall live also, for we are of the same Body, and it was in his Resurrection, that God forgave us all our trespasses.</p>

                  <p>GRace is a Free Acceptation of Sinners in the Righteousness or Justification of Jesus Christ, who was delivered unto Death for our Sins, and raised up again for our Justification.

                  <p>ELection is God's Choosing Men in Christ according to the New Covenant and the Election of one doth always imply the Rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another; for the one being taken, the other is left.</p>

                     <p>Of the Freedom of Man's Will.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere is a Liberty in Beasts, which choose and refuse according to the Dictates of Sense, but the Freedom and Liberty which is given to Man lyes in his Understanding; for a Law is nothing else but a Restraint or Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of absolute Liberty. Beasts have no Law, because they have no Moral Choice; but Man hath a Law given him to Observe, and this is a good Evidence that Man hath a Liberty in his Mind to take or leave, and thence follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Will or Resolntion to this or that, and not to another; thus the Ordering of the Heart is Mans, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 1.</p>

                     <hi>Aether,</hi> which is the Seat both of Light and Darkness, this is the place in which our Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Eve</hi> did receive and debate the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sense from beneath as well as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God from above. It is not a Sin to be tempted, for Christ was tempted in all Points like unto us, yet in him was no Sin, but the Sin is when we yield to the Temptations which are contrary to the Commands and Laws of God: For the Question, Who is Lord in our Soul or Mind, whether it be the Serpent that now work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Children of Disobedience, or whether it be the Spirit of God that beareth Rule in our Soul? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that to whom you yield your selves Servants, his Servants you are whom you obey, whether it be of Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righteousness?</hi> Whosoever he be that Commits sin, is the Servant of Sin. That which determines the Question is our Heart or Love, for where our Heart is there goes our Will, whether it be to things upward, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to things of sense; for we need not go far to know whose we are, the Answer is at hand, the Word is very near us, even the Answer or a good Conscience by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and of our being risen with him through Faith in his Resurrection: But if our Heart Condemn us, God is greater than our Heart and knoweth all things.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF there had been no time limited, there could have been no time shortned; the time limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> was 70 Weeks, which he divided in the middle by the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ into 35 Jubilees of Death, and 35 Jubilees of Life, which made up the 70 Jubilees from the time that God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Holy Angel told <hi>Daniel</hi> that those 70 Weeks were shortned, for the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Word <hi>Nechtac</hi> doth no where signifie determined but abbreviated, and so the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> have translated the Word: The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast also upon <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 11. doth say, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the tune of Subjection, which is like Winter, is compleated, and the Years which I mentioned to</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>between the Divisions are shortned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Number of Years that are shortned are the Number of the Years of Christ after the Flesh. We have but one Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the <hi>Gentiles</hi> must be Partakers as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he Unites both into one Body, therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are reduced, that they might have, as hath been said, their Common

                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Joint Shortning is not of any farther Time, but of Things, it is a shortning of the Violence, Fraud and Cruelty of the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the Crown of Pride among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> against the poor oppressed People.</p>
                  <p>The other Shortning that is joint, is of the <hi>Jews</hi> rejection, whose receiving again will be as Life from the Dead.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore saith the Prophet to these Drunkards of <hi>Ephraim, Be you not Mockers least your Bands be made strong, for I have heard from the Lord God of Hosts a Consumption is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the whole Earth:</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9. 27. from <hi>Isa.</hi> 10, 22. saith, <hi>That tho' the Children of Israel were as the Sand of the Sea, a remnant shall be saved, for he will jointly shorten the Accompt in righteousness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it appears that the oppressed People shall be justified against the Spoils committed by the Drunkards of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> shall be justified and received from their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                  <p>THat as the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Natural Union with Christ, and were his Fathers according to the Flesh in those 1715 Years, even so the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> have Spiritual Union and Communion with him by Faith, for the like space of 1715 Years, for <hi>he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit, and the Head of every Man is Christ.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="4">4. That although the Death of Christ put an end to Sacrifice, for God had no pleasure in them, but God counter-numbered a like Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of 1715 Years, which are thirty five times 49 Years, for the Perfecting of the Saints at the

                  </argument>
                  <p>THat which declareth the whole flux of Time from the Beginning to the End, must be the Word of the ever-living God. Humane Nature is a Constitution of Heaven and Earth. The Lord that made our Outward made our Inward Man also, and hath suited the Revelation of his Will in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures externally to our Ears of the Outward Man, and Internally to our Minds; for we are as a Book written on both sides, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as within, and therefore he hath laid the Foundation of our Faith in Sense.</p>
                  <p>Baptism is not only of Water, but of the Spirit; not only the putting away the Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Flesh, but of the Spirit: Nor is our Outward man commanded to be fed with Bread and Wine, which becomes one with our Body; but our Inward Man is fed by the Faith of our Union with Christ, who dwelleth in us, and we in him, by whom we shall be raised up at the latter day, and so our whole Man, Body, Soul and Spirit, the whole Inheritance of God, rejoyce together.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:39582:43"/>
                  <p>Such as will be led by a Light within, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scripture, fling away their Rule for Trial of Spirits, and forget that their Constitution is Earth as well as Heaven; they would be Angelical, but this was the Angels sin, <hi>they kept not their first estate,</hi> but left their proper Habitation.</p>
                  <p>That which God hath joyned together, let no man separate. No Scripture is of private Interpretation; there is a succession of Voices as well as a succession of Prophets, <hi>Moses, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> and <hi>Medad. Moses</hi> wrote in Shadows, and the seed that was sown by him in the Earth of the Text, lay hid and covered, and from thence it bringeth forth in its Time first the Blade, then the Ear, then the full Corn in the Ear for Harvest. Whatsoever was hid under the Shadowes of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complisht in the Gospel, for <hi>Eldad</hi> the <hi>Beloved of God,</hi> prophesied in the Scriptures, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in them the things that did concern himself, for <hi>Moses</hi> wrote of him.</p>
                  <p>And whatsoever was spoken by our Lord under the Darkness of a Parable, or was whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Ear, shall be spoken fully in the light, and preached over again upon the House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top, when the Building comes to be finished; for then <hi>Medad</hi> the <hi>holy Spirit of Truth</hi> in Christ, will speak no more in Parables, but will show us plainly of the Father. Nor doth this Holy Spirit lay aside the Scriptures, but prophesieth in them as Christ did: Nor will he speak any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:39582:43"/> thing of himself, for a single witness is not true, but what he hears that he speaks, and will shew us Things. <hi>To the Law and to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if they speak not according to this</hi> Word, <hi>it is because there is no Light in them.</hi> Isa. 8. 20.</p>
                  <p>This Spirit of Christ was a Preacher under <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law: But he had an Over-plus of Wisdom, therefore he taught the People fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Knowledge in the dayes of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And will now ballance and set in Order many Parables of Proverbs which are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Gasher,</hi> and they are words of Truth.</p>

                  <p>A Mediator is no more a Mediator of one Testament, than one Scale can be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Ballance that hath but one end; for it is called a Ballance, or <hi>Bilanx, à duabus lancibus.</hi> So a Mediator cannot be a Mediator of one, but there must be another Testament to make the Ballance even.</p>
                  <p>The Shekel of the Sanctuary is the Ballance of the Sanctuary; it is not, as some men think, double to the common Shekel, as Ten is double to Five, but it is equal, as 5 is equal to 5.</p>
                  <p>If we give our Fifth to him, he makes it Ten; for as he is the Mediator of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he doth counterballance the Old: So that as the first <hi>Adam</hi> brought us under a Curse, Jesus Christ turns that Curse into a Blessing: As it is written, <hi>I will lay Judgment,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>to the line, and Righteousness,</hi> or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication <hi>to the</hi> Ballance; but our Translators have unwarrantably translated the word <hi>Plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> Isa. 28. 17.</p>

                     <p>Of the Measure of Time used in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE first Measure of Time used in Holy Scripture is Seven, which is the Measure of the Sabbath day, as well from the beginning of the Old, as from the beginning of the New Creation, which was the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Second Measure of Time is seven times greater than the former, for it contains seven times seven dayes, which is 49 times seven days, and then is Pentecost.</p>
                  <p>This second Measure was used by the Jews in the Celebration of their yearly Feasts. The Romanists and Rituists, that composed our Christian Almanacks, come somewhat near the Jews in their fixing of their Jewish and Roman Feasts. For they have in every year placed <hi>Easter-day</hi> for the day of the Resurrection of our Lord, which Day the Jews called the <hi>Day of First-fruits:</hi> And from <hi>Easter-day</hi> as from a Center they reckon 49 days backward, and call it <hi>Quinquagesima,</hi> or the 50<seg rend="sup">th</seg> day; and they reckon 49 days forward, and call that <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,</hi> or the 50<seg rend="sup">th</seg> day, which they also call <hi>White-Sunday.</hi> These last seven Weeks or seven Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths are called in the Original <hi>Perfect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39582:45"/> they are the Sabbaths of the Resurrection, or of the First Day, and the Seven Weeks are called the <hi>appointed Weeks of the Harvest;</hi> for <hi>Pentecost</hi> was always the last day of Harvest in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But the appointment and Observation of these days in the Gospel-times, is after the Commandments of Men, and not after Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Third Measure of Time is the Sabbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Year, which is seven year for every day, and in every Sabbatical Year you have 369 Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and not day more or less.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Measure of Time is seven times the Sabbatical Year, even 49 Sabbaths of Years, which bring in the Year of Jubilee, which is the Year of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Measure of Time is Ten years for one day; but this Measure is not taken from the Old, but from the New Creation of the World in Jesus Christ, beginning at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and compleats the Year of Redemption for them that seek the Lord, in this Time wherein he may be found. Every day of this is Ten years long, every Week is 70 year long, and the Year is 3650 years long.</p>
                  <p>This great Almanack of the World is a <hi>Solar Calender</hi> hereunto annexed, and may be made use of as easily as a common Almanack, for which end I have used the Familiar Names of the Months, that they may be better understood, until Heathenish Names shall be utterly taken away and abolished.</p>

                  <p>But it is very evident that <hi>Moses,</hi> according to the Wisdom given him of the Spirit doth write much in little, for it may appear from the Iteration of Words, and the Duality of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39582:47"/> Numbers, that he wrote of a twofold Creation in a twofold Work: The first Work was the Creation of the Male, the second of the Female.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that the first day is of the singular Number, and speaketh but of one; (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 4.) but there is another day of the same Number, after the Sabbath of the Seventh day is ended. And this is the first day of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther week, which is the second Revolution of seven days, in which the Woman was formed, and being perfected in the second seven dayes, she is brought to the Man by God the Father upon the Eighth day, which is the fifteenth from the First day of the Old Creation; (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 22.) and then the Bridegroom, which is the Holy Spirit saith, <q rend="margDblQuotes">The Female <hi>Adam</hi> of this Revolution is <hi>Bone of my Bone, and flesh of my flesh, for this cause she shall be called Woman,</hi> because she was <hi>taken from the Man.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE first <hi>Adam</hi> was created Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male in 14 natural dayes; but our Lord Jesus in two weeks, which had seven times five, even thirty five years for the Male; and seven times five, which is 35 years more for the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and so those two Weeks do contain 70 Years, in the which the Male was created in the first Week, and the Female in the second was made and perfected.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first Adam</hi> was, as the Apostle saith, <hi>the figure of him that was to come,</hi> which will more plainly appear, by comparing their several Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations as follows.</p>

                  <p>So in the fixth day of the Creation of our Lord, which was 6 times 5 years, that is to say in the 30th year of his Age, he was buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Waters of Baptism, and under the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision and uncleanness of our Flesh. But when he <hi>arose</hi> up out of those Waters, the Heavens were opened to him, and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily Shape, and lo! a Voice from Heaven, saying, <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Lord caused <hi>a Deep sleep to fall upon Adam</hi> on the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day:</p>
                  <p>So the deep Sleep of Death fell upon Christ in his Grave where he was laid to Rest, upon the Sabbath of the <hi>7th.</hi> day, being the last day of the first <hi>35th.</hi> of his <hi>70th.</hi> year.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As upon the first day of the second Week <hi>Jehova Elohim</hi> did Regenerate the Earth and the Heaven:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the Bridegroom forsakes his Father and his Mother, and cleaves to his Wife, and <hi>they twain shall become one flesh</hi> upon the 8th day:</p>
                  <p>So will the holy Spirit of Christ forsake his Father the unbelieving <hi>Jewes,</hi> and his Mother the

                  <p>THE Truth of this Proposition is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, from the Conformity which the Creation of the World hath to the Creation of Jesus Christ, from the time that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the World were laid, when God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> with the whole Church, which then consisted of Seventy Souls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As in the Beginning of the two Weeks, or 14 dayes, God created the Heaven and Earth of the first <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in the Beginning of the two Weeks in 70 years, God created the Heaven and Earth of his only begotten Son, in the Womb of his Virgin Mother <hi>Mary:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Beginning of the two great Weeks, in 3430 year, that is to say upon the first day thereof, did God go down with <hi>Jacob</hi> and his

                  <p n="1">1. As upon the Seventh day of the first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God rested from all his Works of the first Creation which he created, for making, that is for New making:</p>

                  <p>So upon the last day of the first great Week of 49 times 35, which was the very same Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and the very last day of 1715 years after <hi>Jacob</hi> went down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> did our Lord rest in the Grave according to the Commandment, from all the Works of Righteousness which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or we had done: As his Father rested from all his Works of the first Creation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.</p>

                  <p>So upon the first day of the Second great Week of 1715 years after God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> did <hi>Jehova Elohim</hi> Regenerate upon this very day the Earth and Heaven o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If any Man will Redeem a Redemption from his Tenth, that is, if any Man desire to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Christ, he shall add his Fifth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 31. which is, he must part with all that he hath or is his, he must sell all his own Righteousness, and then he shall have Treasure in Heaven, which is the Righteousness of God by Faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>This is to follow Christ, who parted with his own Righteousness that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</p>
                  <p>This is the Traffique we are Exhorted unto, or the Conversation in Heaven for to make our Five Talents become Ten, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
                  <p>This Tenth is the <hi>Homer</hi> of First-fruits which the Priest under the Law raised or lifted up before the Lord for our Acceptation on the Day
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:39582:53"/> of First-fruits, which was the Day of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ from the Dead: He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for all them that believe as the Increase of the Threshing-floor, and as the Increase of the Wine-press, for God hath put all things under his Feet, and given him to be Head over all to his Church, which is his Body, the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of him that filleth all in all; so that <hi>in the Lord we have Righteousness and Strength,</hi> Isa. 45. 24. and in Him all the Seed of <hi>Israel</hi> are Justified and shall Glory.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Some brief Observations concerning Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TRue and Saving Faith is a Believing that <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Christ is the Head of every Man by Grace of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> is the Head of every Man by Natural Generation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we are Justified by Faith when we believe our Union and Communion with Christ in his Death and Resurrection, as he is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator that dyed for our Sins, and was raised up again for our Justification; as it is written, <hi>they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:39582:54"/> twain shall be one Flesh, and he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are Justified by Faith when we believe our Union with Christ is as the Union of Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the Vine, so that He is One with Us, and We with him, for He dwelleth in Us and We in him, that We can never perish but be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the last Day.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is by Virtue of this Union and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ in his Death that we are set free from sin, because he dyed for our sins in our stead, and so he satisfied the Law for us. And by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our Union and Communion with him in his Resurrection we are made Partakers of the Free Grace of God in forgiving us all our Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, and giving us the Inheritance of Eternal Life with himself, not of Merit by Works, but of his Free and undeserved Grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are by Virtue of this Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ called Saints, but our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness doth not lye in our selves but in him who is our Head.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Exercise of our Faith is a continual Warfare between the Flesh and the Spirit, between Faith and Unbelief, because of our sins; so that under Hope we are carried to believe above Hope, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in the Uncircumcision and Uncleanness of his Flesh.</p>
                  <p>As to the Second Coming of Christ to Restore all things, it will be by his Spirit in his People in the Power of <hi>Elias,</hi> for he will be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all them that believe.</p>

                     <hi>A Calendar</hi> is a borrowed word, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to the <hi>Moon,</hi> for the Calends of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But the Sun hath neither Months nor Calends, nor can the Motion of the Moon answer the Motion of the Sun by 11 dayes, which they call the <hi>Epacts</hi> in ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that the Monthly Calendar of the Moon; tho it have its Column in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheless, I thought fit to give it a place in this great Year; because there is scarce a man of any small business in <hi>Europe,</hi> but makes use of the common yearly <hi>Almanack,</hi> or <hi>Calendar,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:39582:56"/> and is well acquainted with the Names of the Twelve Months, and with the Number of dayes in every Month, and that there are 52 Weeks or Sabbaths in every year, and one day overplus, which makes 365 dayes in the year.</p>
                  <p>So that this <hi>Solar Calendar</hi> is nothing else but a familiar comparing of the Dayes, Weeks and Sabbaths in the Yearly Almanack, which every Man knows, with the Dayes, VVeeks and Sabbaths in the great Year of our Redemption, which hath been kept secret since the VVorld began, but is now reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Spirit to be as aforesaid Ten Years for every Natural Day, Seventy Years for every Natural VVeek, and 3650 Years for the great Year of our Redemption, as by this <hi>SOLAR CALENDAR</hi> will most plainly appear.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Solar Calendar,</hi> or the Worlds <hi>Almanack,</hi> doth begin at the time of the Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the 2078. year of the World, and in order 3650. years after, in the Year of the World 5728. It hath Twelve Months, and every Month hath Four Columns.</p>
                  <p>The First Column containeth the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Dayes in each Month, beginning at the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> which is the Tenth day of <hi>March,</hi> having 365 dayes in the Year of XII. Months.</p>
                  <p>The Second Column contains the Years of the World since the Creation, and therein you may see, what year of the World answereth to the Year of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:39582:57"/>
                  <p>The Third Column containeth the Years since the Promise was made, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Year of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Column is the broad Space, which contains some Divine Record of Time, and of things performed in that Time, as well in what Year of Promise, as in what Year of the World.</p>
                  <p>This Fourth Column contains also the Beginning and Ending of the 49 Weeks of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which are also called <hi>The 70 Weeks,</hi> they begin at the Time when God went down with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and end with the last day of the Promise, and of the great Year of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of the present World, for there is no day more or less in the Accompt.</p>
